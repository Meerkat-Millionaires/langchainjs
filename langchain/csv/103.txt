That is really weird for me (someone who wakes up every morning singing)  Singing is definitely back in my world now, and it helps.  Think of you a lot, and all our fun times.  Sang at the church on Sunday evening.  I did Myrna's song \"Between Jesus and Me\".  You and I worked on it quite a bit.  I can hear your voice in my head all the time.  (Do not breathe when their is only one word left...you know you don't have to...you just think you do)    I was up to your house with a coffee for you the other day.    Glad to hear Reggie is doing so great.   Nothing better than children!!!   I'll give you a call, and maybe we can have coffee!   Take care my Friend......."

I know you are still reeling from your mom's passing...my heart goes out to you and yours. And I know that music will ease your pain and your soul. You are a terrific person. I also hope that the house is working out. We continue to \"go on going on\" here. It is wonderful to spend so much time with Reggie; a vibrant, smart as a whip, determined, physically and intellectually  advanced (even though I do say so myself and obviously am biased), funny and stubborn (where did that come from?)...lol.... I have come to finally accept the COPD prognosis and life-style needed to retard its progression as much as possible...have had to leave lots of activities that I have tremendously enjoyed over the years which caused some months of depression...gone now. Jarett and his girlfriend are currently living here after Jarett took a dive a few months ago...they are dealing well with sharing accomodations and diligently seeking new employment so that they can again live on their own. They brought 2 cats with them (thankfully, HA, found homes for 2 others), I also found a home for a sweet puppy that Tiana rescued a number of months back and that I cared for just cause; that's the way it is....still dog-sitting the Big Dog Mon to Fri (a truly lovely girl)..so this is just the tip of the iceberg...I am busy and feeling much better about things than before. On the verge of beginning to paint again and writing quite often....let me know what's up...perhaps you could drop in for coffee sometime...now, that would be fun."

We may not have him much longer...the Doctor says it could be a couple weeks or maybe if we are lucky 3 or 4 months.   The tumor in his bowel is growing fast and he is on pain meds every hour or two.  A lot of gas and belly pain.   The biggest problem is his bowel blocking, which is what has been happening.   He now has 4 tumors in his liver...But they are not the problem.  I had him out for the day and he had a wonderful day.  I want to take him again tomorrow.   Take care  ... Lynda"
