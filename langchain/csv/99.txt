What more can one ask? Good luck with ALL your (and family's) health challenges. I do think of you often, but have been taking more breaks from the laptop than before...but ALWAYS do the daily Chronicle Herald crossword puzzle, a mental kickstart to each day. Keep well. Keep me informed. And, yes, Mother's Day was pretty terrific, thanks to Tiana. Miss Damion on these days and Jare doesn't really get the whole idea of celebration days."

I bless my dad for passing on this ability to laugh (certainly did not get it from my mother!!!). I miss him always. Had a chuckle this AM when I heard thumping, bumping and the Big Dog (all 140 pounds of her) appeared from around the corner with the top half of the kitty litter box stuck on her head...it was hilarious (not painful for her)....sort of a canine Star Wars soldier."

I can't imagine how you felt (or perhaps I can, to some degree) and how hard it would be to recover from what amounts to an verbal assault. No sense seeking redress, since it's too complicated, painful and the med profession protects its own at all times. I've had some pretty horrendous experiences that impacted members of my family and, in the end, found myself just having to \"suck it up, Buttercup\".....then the process of finding another way if possible. Strength is a personal issue. Just when we are sure there is absolutely none left, we find another teeny, tiny reservoir deep inside. Kind of like the 'loaves and fishes' since the tiny amount we find seems to expand when we access it. Weird, yes? I know that you have this strength. I will be thinking of you every day."

It was frightful. He had to return to live with me over and over after so many attempts at independent living.... a long journey, but now is pretty good...great apartment, working at home, a wonderful partner Melanie who also has issues, 4 (yup, 4 !! ) kitties, enough income to keep the roof over his head, sees his psychiatric nurse for his monthly injection, money for meds and handling adversity so much better. It is an ongoing battle but he has the support of his family (for the most part) and friends. His bravery and courage has never been completely extinguished despite the roller coaster ride he's on.

We begin  obedience. Class this weekend and hope  that all  of us will be successful because  in the long run,we just love her!  I am sorry. Thatyou  lost  your  dog. It is like a family member  passing and the grief is very real.  \n    I enjoyed your picture  of some of the family while  voting\n Fred and I watched   The whole event  yesterday. I found it exciting .\n    Carrie had a major pAnic attack at the call center where she just started work  and did not. return . She is discouraged and uncertain of herself now.   Can't get in to the  psychiatrist for  Carrie until  dec.23.  She is worried about student  loans etc.   And the beat goes on..\n  Christy returns for  Christmasand then after goes t NYC .  She loved. Broadway kWw and it is  along way  from Baffin Island!\"\n Our choir is doing a little bit of filler songs. For this Remembrance Day concert.( not my favourite)\n  But Christmas  music is enjoyable to sing"

Thanks for your update and here goes mine: Oldest (Damion) is in Ottawa making obscene amounts of $ doing computer stuff and raising two very strong-willed young ladies (Renee and Emily) so, along with their mom Meghan, they're in for an eventful life!! Girls are 5 and 7.  I see them whenever possible, but not enough. Miss my oldest as well, but he works 24/7. Tiana is amazing...works on two Reserves doing addiction/mental health therapy.  Hasn't found anyone to spend her life with so has gone the IVF route and is expecting as a single mother in April!! We are living in New Glasgow (having finally given up the country life...so labor intensive) and share a two sectioned enormous old home that serves our purposes well....I have the bottom flat (living room, dining room (which is now my bedroom), bedroom( which is now my art room), kitchen, music room (which Tiana also uses for private consults), bathroom, laundry room and den in basement. Started with the abstract art about a year and a half ago (having finally given up the musicals) and have (still amazed by this) actually sold about 11.....small to large. Also teach one young boy with learning disabilities. Keeping the roof over my head with CPP and about 17 students (piano and voice). Love all the wood and character in this house.  "

Did you ever hear the broadway play \"once\" ? I am loving the music.It's been alot of time since we've last communicated. I have your commorant painting up in the hall upstairs and when I saw you writing on facebook, I thought this was the time. One time, we attended somthing at that United Church centre in Tatamagouch Ns and you had advertised about flowers  (perrenials) for sale. Looks like you are very involved in teaching music.Fred is retired but doing what I call supply teaching, but it's preaching. He has a stint in tabusintac nb from Nov. to June in the united church. Christy's teaching and doing resource in Kimmurut NU. Ben is working with a temp agency in Halfax and Carrie is living with us. I was sick with aninfected hernia due to allergies with the mesh  andmany surgeries for the past 10 years.  I am better than I was but the story continue. However, Christy, Carrie and I drove to New York and saw these broadway shows. It was so exciting and stimulating.  I was very tired afterwards but what a wonderful experience. It was so LOUD!  Anyway, when you can, I would love to hear from YOU!"
