Also, on my front porch, there is a bed frame thingy...brand-new, unopened, for free if you want it, someone you know does or if you wish to sell it., fine."

I have had an up/and/down health experience during all this and  know it must be awful for you too.....I am wondering if Mike is able to do outside work with no contact with the person inside?  I don't know what his health is like, but It would mean raking gravel off my lawn and the parking area, cutting the new growth off of the big tree bottoms, and a bit of other stuff....he wouldn't have any contact with people and I am able to offer 25.00 an hour. Please let me know if this is possible. I do miss you both."
