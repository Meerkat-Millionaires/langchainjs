One aspect of the fallout has been a visit to my by the Easy Home people. I am searching for information re a stereo, keyboard and mouse....I believe that the mouse is in the hospital, so I will retrieve that and replace it with a cheap one by tomorrow. If you have any idea about the stereo and keyboard, please let me know. Tiana has told me that you wouldn't mind going to the apartment and getting Jare's belongings....at this point there is only his personal items: clothes, wallet, etc. I have no idea what is there, but there are no home furnishings at all. If you could do this, I would would be most grateful, and they can be dropped off to me. If you can't/don't wish to do this....it's OK too.  What a mess."
