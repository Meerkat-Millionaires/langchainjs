I am very lonesome for Benny but starting not to think he is still here for quick moments.  I am going to try staying in our house, as this is where I feel him - however, if and when my faith may start to fail, I'll have to make differences.  Paul has been great to come and do things to get me ready for winter.  I will look you up one day when I'm in New Glasgow - are you still off Kirk Hill. Jillian knows where you live there.  Take care   Ruth"
