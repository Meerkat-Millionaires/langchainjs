Discussions were off-the-wall and of no real help since he is in his own mind set right now....what he tells me happened may or may not have occured (his perceptions are skewed), but they told him Thursday is possible for getting renewals from Randy...althiugh Jarett tried to contact 2 psychiatrists he has seen over the past two years.....Tiana and I both know that we do not have the answers, but I am still hanging in there, although it affects my breathing...staying as calm as possible.  No sleep really so today is low key....he has been asleep for a while now. Perhaps this will be another tempest in a teacup and we can continue with another stretch of \"sort-of-OKdom\".....trying to offset this stress with some gardening, friends, music and stuff. please send me your phone number ASAP"

He can keep the apartment he has if the others who have camped out there will move out, he will find another place with a friend who has to find some means of contributing financially, he will stay here, etc. I find it all so repetitious since this is again the same scenario as a number of times before. They were asked to leave due to noise (but Jare is not the offender here, just a patsy). In addition, he is finding it difficult to obtain work so must rely on the Disability Assistance which covers rent and a tad extra (not much to live on). Also, his laptop (an old one of Damion's) has decided to not work. So I am at the moment letting him use mine, but I cannot let him take it away if/when he moves out of here.  Oh my, will let you know how it all unfolds. I am finally feeling BETTER!!!!   Yahoo!"

And it isn't anything new so I am adopting a laid back attitude. He did get his shot, and picked up a new form re housing from Social Assistance (Disability) and got the rest of his meds filled, so at least that is reassuring. Will let you know more as I find out. Going to start puttering in the garden today, do some cooking, freezing. Laundry is all caught up. Lawn will be mowed today (weather permitting)...not by me, alas, alack. There are two rose bushes crying out to be planted so maybe that can be done as well. I rely on the kindness of son/daughter for these tasks.
