I have written many letters o ER my two years regarding mental illness and most recently had a column in the advocate before this unacceptable announcement - believe me I am fighting hard to keep it open!  I hope you read my column as I posted it on my FB page.   Keep the faith as we move forward to ensure this service continues.   Perhaps, I will see you on Monday if you stop by.   Hope you are well.  Hugs!"
