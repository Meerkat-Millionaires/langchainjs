Never did plant those damn daffodils, so will HAVE to be around next fall!! Sending a message to Tiana that fI have \"foggy\" times almost everyday, not desperate but please ask me if I have written dates/times on my calendar when there is an upcoming appointment....becoming much more careful about depending on memory. thanks.",
