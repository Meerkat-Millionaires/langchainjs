Isaac accompanied on piano for first time, Jesus loves me, he said it was really hard to play while people sing! And sometimes I get him to play random songs he likes before and after.             Charlotte will be singing various festival songs at both my churches over the next month.  Hope Jarrett is doing better soon. Reggie must be so much fun. Take care of yourself!"

Shelley said he's through the equivalent of Grade 2, I think, starting grade 3. He loves playing peppy ones like Rockin' Robin, Ding dong merrily on high, Heart and Soul. Also plays Sleeping Dragon.           We miss you, you gave them all such a great start. Charlotte sang 2nd soprano/alto in CCNS, and it really helped that she knew how to read music."

Isaac did an excellent drum solo, received an 87, played Caribbean Gumbo, 2nd out of two, as he said the other was a grade 8! Isaac's ensemble played French national march and their band played Childhood hymn and Newfoundland Folk song(with Matthew in band on bass) and got a silver.            Charlotte's music festival, God help outcasts, was 83. Her folk I was away for, Cherry Tree carol, 90, tied for 3rd in group of 9. Sacred, All through the Night, 88, 3rd place in group of 9. Lastly, Vocal - If you become the moon (the best I ever heard her sing it with her big voice!), 89, tied for 3rd in group of 5.    Adjudacator for the last 2 was really good.   There, you asked for it!  A good experience. Made for a whirlwind April with Children's chorus of NS at the middle of the month.  And Charlotte's choir Sinneadair got a silver, and singing with Trinitarians a gold. The joint choirs are singing at Festival of Stars tomorrow, and just heard that Charlotte is one of the kids getting a prize - guess we will stay for the whole thing!"

Had a rescue puppy for a few months while trying to find it a good home (sweet, but active !), still dog sitting the Big Dog 5 days a week  and Reggie two days plus overnights, times when Tiana does Consults in what was the Music room. I have Jarett and his girlfriend staying with me for a while, another glitch in the Mental Health progress but again on the road to better times...they will stay until jobs are sorted out and finances improved. They also brought 2 cats (count my blessings that they found homes for 2 others !!!) and so there are 4 cats now. Before the rescue pup left for her new home, it was Bedlam...lol. Reggie is great, active, bright and fun (cept  for the TWOS issue). Tell me about the boys and give my love (in form of a big hug, to them all). How did the Festival work out? for the Musical Theatre. What else is she doing? And how's the piano progressing for Isaac?"

Charlotte sang 'Gospel Train' at church on Sunday, and Isaac played Angels we have heard on high, Ding dong merrily on high, and Deck the halls during the offering. After the benediction amen,, he yelled, 1, 2, 3, and launched into Rockin robin. People didn't know what to think! It truly added to our theme of joy! I think I'll ask them to repeat it at my little church next Sunday. Take care of yourself. Wishing you peace and joy this Christmas to you, Tiana and Reggie, Lara"

Matthew has gum surgery next week, then braces.               They are healthy and well and we had an amazing time during the summer.   Charlotte is already pushing Isaac to audition for the school musical, he says he will. Band has begun and both boys are enjoying it.

Tiana has a wonderful man in her life now and looks long term, he loves her and Reggie. He's a kind, intelligent fellow and I am hoping that she has found her companion. Not able to visit with my two little (not so little ) ones in Ottawa..some breathing issues for me, but manageable if I take it easy..some days diamonds, some stones. Loving the time with Reggie.

Matthew had his first in water scuba diving lesson today, is driving the motor boat, and waterskiing! Isaac is swimming, tubing and building/programming lego robots (maybe organ lessons for fun in August), and Charlotte is swimming, tubing, playing dolls, and looking forward to camp in August (and enjoying the 'bunky' Carl made 6 meters away where she can sleep and get away from her brothers! I am loving not working.   My parents and their church/organist would like Charlotte to sing Song for the Mira on Sun August 2. I will practice with her, we have song on iPod, but I didn't bring the book with music. Organist is pretty capable, may be able to find it. I know to look for the proper ending 'princes and kings', but what key does she sing it in?   She'll practice with the organist ahead of time.   Thanks for your help, all the best, Lara"
