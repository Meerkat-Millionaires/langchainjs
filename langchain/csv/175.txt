I teach both one hour or  half hour sessions per week. The cost is 15.00 for a half hour and 29.00 for an hour. Fees are payable on the first lesson of the month for the entire month with credits given on the first lesson of the next month if I have to cancel.....rescheduling is a possibility if you can't make a lesson.  How far did you reach when you did take lessons and (if piano) what program were you using (if you can recall)? My email is      lesleydunn@live.com\n     \nHoping to hear from you and thanks for your interest.\n\n(Sorry about the delay in  responding...internet problems)\n"
