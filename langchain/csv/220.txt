He's in Truro hospital at last contact (yesterday)...I have no idea what he will accept or demand as his next steps, but he cannot come home....I am ill and unable to ride this roller coaster...been 10 years of it and finally have accepted that I personally cannot change anything, hope the system can , but you know that he's always got \"another plan\".  thanks for all your help."
