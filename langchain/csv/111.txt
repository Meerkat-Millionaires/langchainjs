You are certainly entitled to your view but entertainment is in the eye of the beholder and I hold no grudge whatsoever for bringing this to my attention . Facebook is for my entertainment and I will post as an adult in this forum some posts that all may not like or agree with but I will do this with no harm intended to anyone ...... And of course I will NOT delete you Leslie everyone is entitled to their point of view \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u0097"
