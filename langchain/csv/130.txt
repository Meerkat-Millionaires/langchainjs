Gerry ha given up the provincial festival presidensy, somthey are wanting to slow down, and they have a new grand child out west to visit.). Lynn Decoste  who teaches Amelia Parker . StephanieHiggs(maiden name- parents Stepehn and Debbie), Ann Holten, Robin Alcorn. Maybe Amanda Mac  Intosh. Jackie Rogue. most would already have thier students for this year.    Issacs mother took  church in Point Claire Quebec. He is taking piano from the church organist, and Charlotte is taking voice form someone. Charlotte has not taken the move well. I really enjoyed Issac. Take care, how is your granddaughter? She must be a pleasure ."
