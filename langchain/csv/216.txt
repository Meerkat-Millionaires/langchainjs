They sent it yesterday as promised this time but they did it after banks close so the bank marked it as complete today. This means that the processor will see it tomorrow. Although here in the screenshot the CEO said that they're just missing payments? somehow? somewhere? Regardless, should they receive the payment as planned then it's just on them now to send it to the right place. This is something they've actually fucked up twice in a row before, and there's $5000 sitting on a blockchain address I used to be associated with that nobody has access to. This is an lol I wonder what it'll be worth when BTC is like zillions. \n\nhttps://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3JpaadjYTwDQfgukqg3qctbVcoPYBeSiuR\n\nDown to like $4100 right now.\n\nAs an lol, from this one address I used for part of 2016 to auto-sell btc processed by bitwage.com into CAD on QuadrigaCX - just one of my addresses - this is fun: t has received a total of 13.92765521 BTC ($653,697.70) and has sent a total of 13.83922574 BTC ($649,547.24) ... $usd values. ha\n\nWhen they fucked this up before they ended up lending me the $ after dozens of emails back and forth and a couple days wasted time and effort.\n\nLending me money they fucking lost.\n\nAnyways so long as that shit all works out, should have pay tomorrow :) :)\n\nI hate my life",

She feels emotion close to her chest and wears her arm on her sleeve, but honestly the inspiration for this song came from talking about my other good friend's miracle baby and I wanted to make it clear so hear me: whether you're down, yup, about your chances to get knocked up, or you're worried about the virality of your little spermies guys I want to tell you that my niece was made with love.. and science! She ain't got no dad and it weighs on her concience, but I tell her hey I've never ever met mine either and it's probably for the better. Anyways guys she's gonna be a rockstar, ballerina or doctor but whatever she puts her mind to she fuckin conquers. And hey I'm actually Reg the Third, depending on where on the internet you heard, but this song is one of my first ten ever written with ink and pen and it's going down in history titled Reg the Fourth, forever with her the force. And I already warned my sister hey I'm unsure I won't butcher the first guy or gal that breaks her heart, maybe for sure. I guess that's a scary way to phrase the sentiment but I finally understand all the dads, brothers or even guardians of other genders that interviewed me in the past or even said 'I'm not sure you should date my daughter.' Cuz Reg my little dude, you're precious. And seeing you cry turns me somewhat vicious. So keep your chin up, girl, there's loads to look forward to in this world, cruel though it may be we keep positive and shining, and remember to see the silver lining. I hope to crap you grow up and remember all the times we shared together, from casual afternoons gaming and shooting the shit, or even the very serious lessons about growing up... bit by bit. Cuz to me, Reggie, you'll always be the wee little bundle of joy, happy or crying, that only ever fell asleep to the sound of me singing. Do you remember the evil game? With random books and spells of flame? You insisted on always being the bad guy and dude you're just a little fry but to me you're one of the only reasons when I'm down, out, sad lonely and bored that I have to keep on moving forward. Now, you're growing into an older being and you're getting more comfortable with your reading so soon enough I'll introduce you to that lifetime subscription I got you to learn how to do whatever you want in Roblox and Minecraft and by the time you're 10 you'll make my code look daft. That's not an empty promise it would make my life worthwhile and just be super fun to teach you something to unleash your creativity on everyone. You already love to art, act and sing but bro, dude, lil tiny one, literally all the technology you love like a religion thing is honestly thinking in 1s and 0s and you will learn how to have absolute power over the machine minds, you coder kids are tomorrow's heroes. And this bit is the most important, and I hope you listen to this whenever you might have a fit or you lose something or someone close to you again, it's tragic but I want to promise you this, kid: the impressions you leave on others through your choices and actions and kindness are in fact the legacy we all leave for each other. It's bliss. Your art and any other way anyone chooses to communicate, even an offhand hiss, or giving your Mammoo a kiss, lives on forever and ever. Some religion somewhere has a particular endeavor to teach you that everyone has two deaths: the first is when you stop breathing in your chest, the second is the very last time someone breathes your name - or thinks of you, fondly or maybe in jest."

Just last two days tim was here got obliterated drunk ignored his girlfriend and roommate, roommate is a bigger fella and wanted to come in here and fight me over enabling his addictions. Guys I may be an enabler but if I didn't then these guys and other folks wouldn't have safe places to come to terms with their pain or traumatizing loss. Tim literally just lost a friend to cancer a few weeks ago and tonight told me this person was more important in his life than his own mother, I said to him that when I lose my mom I don't know what will happen but it'll be a long and miserable road filled with lots of bad decisions to recover. Then he says and I'll be right there with you because your mom means a lot to me just cuz she does to you. And I gave him a big hug and said just like I'm caring for you now. \n\nBut anyways the repercussions of this are sometimes nearly dying in luke's case or going clinically insane in both their cases and who knows what else. \n\nI'm literally just trying to have a good time with friends. \n\nNow, having money has enabled me to enable people more often and more effectively. Even more money I will have soon will likely kill off me and a whole slew of degenerates.\n\nI'll be home tomorrow by 11 and I'm staying home, staying sober for a long long time and ignoring everyone who isn't family or a close friend from childhood. This includes luke but he's been sober and he's far away. I'll smarten up do my bit and help every day, starting when I get home maybe have a nap and completely renovate that room of mine.
