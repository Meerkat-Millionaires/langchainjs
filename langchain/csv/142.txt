For next time, a gloss is $35 and a haircut is $45 so we will start fresh next month! \n\nI'm so hopeful that you have the same experience with David that I had!"

I have a question for you....a bit of background (the incredibly short version): have had a run of lousy health issues since Easter...now beginning the lengthy process of healing a compression fracture of the spine. In serious need of some uplifting experiences....do you do in-house consultations re hair renovations? I cannot go to an appt (mobility curtailed), but am willing to pay for a visit here plus for whatever  improvements that can possibly be done in the home. I am located one block up from Temperance St on George St/Mackay St. corner. 755-6759 or message me here if yea or nay. This is a situation of severe neglect ...lol"
