We are well and lots of fun activity with the little one, Tiana's daughter Reggie (named after my dad)...they live upstairs which is GREAT.....I do a lot of care-giving. Also babysit her bull mastiff. Jarett and his partner have moved in with me for an interim period of time; working out well s far. Glad to hear re the music lessons and I send you lots of good vibes...bet you have fun with it again....I was sorry to quit teaching, but dealing with my COPD has necessitated a number of changes in my way of living, but I am still lovin' livin' !!!!!!  Painting, writing all go well. Keep safe and keep happy."

He is taking lessons from Angela Campbell (Music teacher at Pictou Elem. but on maternity leave). As well I have decided to take lessons too but not with her. I take them with Paula Milman- she uses a different series and surprisingly enough I am doing not too bad- can remember many things- a testimony to your good teaching- but I also tell her my downfalls Ha!!!!"
