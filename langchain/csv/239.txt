Work has been extremely difficult on my mind and body lately. I'm sure you heard sobeys cut a lot of jobs..\nWhen they announced all the cuts, we lost our 2 girls in NL who basically do what I do. We also found out that Kathy (theres 3 of us here in stellarton) is being moved to merchandising as of february. Then Vanessa (the other girl) left on stress leave a month ago.\nKathy hasnt been in in 2 weeks.\nIts literally been me there alone, doing 5 peoples jobs, covering 4 provinces of customers.\nIts insane. I'm feeling depressed and stressed and anxious and tired etc. I cant handle it much longer. Ive worked 12-14 hour days. Its been a tough go:("
