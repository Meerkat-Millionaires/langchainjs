I know that you did NOT mean any disrespect, because I know you are a wonderful woman....I appreciate your response. My mother was Bi-Polar (my childhood was horrific due to her non-diagnosis), I have battled with Bi-Polar and one of my sons' Illnesses is partly Bi-Polar.....and we have developed a \"black humor\" to deal with it. Enough said.  I understand the musical was \"Fabulous\"......With you in it, it couldn't be anything else. !!!!!."

I know a great deal about bi-polar and many illnesses as I work with children and deal with mental illness as well regularly. I really did not look at the words to go any further than the cuteness of it!"
